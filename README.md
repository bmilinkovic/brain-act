# Brain-Act

A computational neuroscience project conducted at the Destexhe Lab (Institut des Neurosciences - NeuroPSI, CNRS) focused on developing personalised whole-brain models for patients with Disorders of Consciousness (DoC). The goal is to create *virtual twins* for *in silico* experiments, including digital pharmacological interventions, with a particular emphasis on the *effects of psychedelics*.

## Data Directory

The `data/` directory contains research data files that are not tracked in version control due to their size and sensitivity. This includes:

- `DoC_SC/` - Data files
- `DoC_bold_correct_indicies/` - Data files

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have the necessary data files in the `data/` directory
3. Install required dependencies (if any)
4. Run your analysis scripts from the `code/` directory

## Contributing

Please ensure that:
- Data files are not committed to the repository
- Code changes are properly documented
- Large files are handled appropriately
